## About

A lot of good virtual services get destroyed every year because they are hacked by evildoers that take advantage of common exploits and simple passwords.  With large numbers of linux newcomers flocking to enter the space and set up masternodes I saw a need for a simple way to secure virtual servers that would, for the most part, keep the bad guys out.

I aggregated these steps from several different server hardening guides and picked and chose the most effective of them to include in this script.  The goal is to make something simple enough for the newcomers to use while still being practical and useful for the linux veterans.  I am certainly open to suggestions and would like to keep this easy and practical to use.



## Installation

SSH to your VPS and clone the Github repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akcryptoguy/VPS-Server-Hardening.git && cd vps
```

Install & configure :

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will then walk you through each of the server hardening steps, offering prompts for feedback and special notes along the way.
